# Real-Time-Speech-Translation-and-Text-to-Speech-System
This project implements a real-time speech recognition, translation, and text-to-speech conversion system using Python. The system captures audio input through the microphone, transcribes the speech into text using the SpeechRecognition library, and then detects the language of the spoken text using the googletrans library. The user can select a target language, and the system will translate the recognized speech into that language. Once the translation is completed, the translated text is converted into audible speech using the gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) library. This allows the user to hear the translation in real-time, making the system a powerful tool for multilingual communication. The project supports several languages, including Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, and English, and offers a smooth user experience with minimal setup. Users are prompted to speak, and the system processes the input, detects the language, translates it, and plays the translated speech back to the user. The system is designed to be simple to use, with built-in error handling for common issues like unrecognized speech or translation failures. It provides helpful feedback to users, ensuring smooth operation even in noisy environments. The system can be easily extended to support additional languages or enhanced features, making it a versatile solution for various applications. This project showcases the integration of speech processing, natural language translation, and text-to-speech technologies, providing a seamless multilingual communication tool. Itâ€™s ideal for applications like language learning, travel, or accessibility tools, where real-time translation and audio output are needed.
