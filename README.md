# Real-Time-Speech-Translation-and-Text-to-Speech-System
This Python-based project captures speech, detects its language, translates it to a selected language, and converts the translation to speech using SpeechRecognition, Google Translate API, and gTTS. It provides real-time multilingual communication, ideal for language learning, travel, or accessibility tools.
